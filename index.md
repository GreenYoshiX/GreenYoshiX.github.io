# About

Lets take a journey of discovering Jesus all throughout the Bible. Along the way I pray we grow, learn and discover how to listen to God in an ever darkening world. This blog is intended with several purposes.
    1. To Dispense Hope
        There is quite a bit of disparaging news and often times people can get carried away in that. However, thanks to the hope that Jesus gives, we don't have to succumb to negative emotions (fear, anger, depression).
    
    2. To spread a Biblical understanding of who Jesus is and why we need Him in our lives.
        If I can say I am passionate about anything, it is Jesus, my Savior. God tells us in the gospel of Mark, chapter 16, verse 16, "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature." This is my intention. 

So, come with me on this journey of discovery, as I document my findings of who Jesus is and what his life and death means for us.
