## Isaiah 53:5
"But He was pierced through for our transgressions, He was crushed for our iniquities; The chastening for our peace *fell* upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed."

## John 1:1-4
"In the beginning was the Word and the word was with God and the Word was God.
He was in the beginning with God.
All things came into beingthrough Him, and apart from Him nothing came into being that has come into being.
In Him was life, and the life was the Light of men."
