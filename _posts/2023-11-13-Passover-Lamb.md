12:2 “This month shall be unto you the beginning of month: it shall be the first month of the year to you.”
	◦	Just as when Jesus died for our sins as the Passover Lamb, a new calendar began (was created)

12:3 “Speak ye unto the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for an house:”
	◦	A single lamb to cover the sins of the house
	◦	The sacrifice of one, perfect person covers the sins of all who come to him.

12:5 “Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats:”
	◦	Jesus was without blemish, that is, he was without sin. 

12:7 “And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper door post of the houses, wherein they shall eat it.”
	◦	We are saved by the blood of Jesus, our Passover lamb
	⁃	When we are covered by the blood of the lamb, God will Passover our sins, He will overlook them.

12:13 “And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt.”
	◦	When God sees us, He sees us covered in the blood of Jesus, our Passover Lamb.
