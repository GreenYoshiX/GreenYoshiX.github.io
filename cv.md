## Jesus Christ our Savior

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
    - John 1:1

* Ut enim ad minim veniam
* Quis nostrud exercitation
* Ullamco laboris nisi
* For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.
    - 1 Thessalonians 5:9

### Words of Encouragement

In today's world, it is easy to fall into the trap of fear. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and love, and of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). Despite how dark our world is getting I understand that it will only get worse. However, because of what I have learned from the Bible and grown in my faith in Christ, I am encouraged. God's Word tells us exactly what is to come. I've read the end of the book, I know how this story ends. The Bible, God's inspired Word, is powerful. Trust in Jesus Christ our Savior and you too can have the peace that surpasses all understanding.
