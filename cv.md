## Jesus Christ our Savior

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
    - John 1:1

* Ut enim ad minim veniam
* Quis nostrud exercitation
* Ullamco laboris nisi
* For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ.
    - 1 Thessalonians 5:9

### Words of Encouragement

In today's world, it is easy to fall into the trap of fear. 
    
--For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and love, and of a sound mind (2 Timothy 1:7). 
    
The world we live in is a dark place and only getting worse. However, its important to understand that because of the truths in the Bible, followers of Christ live with joy and hope. God's Word tells us exactly what is to come. I've read the end of the book, I know how this story ends. The Bible, God's inspired Word, is powerful. Trust in Jesus Christ our Savior and you too can have the peace that surpasses all understanding. 

--Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.   (Philippeans 4:6-7)
